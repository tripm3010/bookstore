- **Identity Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Profile Service**: Handles user profile management.
- **Post Service**: Manages book listings and related content.
- **File Service**: Supports file uploads and storage.
- **Notification Service**: Sends user notifications via email or other channels.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly frontend developed with ReactJS.

All services are containerized with Docker and orchestrated using `docker-compose`.
